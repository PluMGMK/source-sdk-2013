This is the Git repository for the VIGoV Subatomic Particle Simulator, distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but with no warranty.
As it is, this is pretty much ready-to-compile, once you use the Valve Project Creator (in the manner specified in the SDK setup instructions at https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_SDK_2013
The server binaries will be placed in the sp/game/vigov_simulator folder. This can be copied into Steam's sourcemods directory, but you will need the client and shader binaries from the mod_episodic folder as well.

As of 4 January 2015, this no longer compiles against the GNU Scientific Library, so all legal issues are resolved, you can redistribute both source and binaries according to the same licence used by Valve on the SDK
